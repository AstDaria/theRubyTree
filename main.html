						<h3>media • harrods launch</h3>
						<p>Launching exclusively at Harrods in London, the ultimate world city, The Ruby Tree Collection draws on the timeless beauty of the courtly arts of the Islamic world, immortalised in 1,001 Arabian Nights, and the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. The Ruby Tree creates works of great beauty and refinement, made from the heart. Whether designed for a private residence, a grand hotel, a national monument or a memorable occasion, each piece is unique, with the subtle, individual variations that separate the handcrafted from the mass-produced.</p>

						<h3>inspiration • materials</h3>
						<p>The golden age of Islamic culture excelled in science, philosophy, mathematics, astronomy and the arts. Visionary rulers such as Haroun al-Rashid, Shah Abbas, Suleiman the Magnificent, and Emperor Akbar created a world of such style and splendour that its influence spread across the globe. Their courts were the wonder of the age, a fairytale world of dazzling richness and refinement. In the royal ateliers the greatest masters of the age created outstanding objets d’art to enchant their patrons. The Ruby Tree Collection is inspired by the beauty and brilliance of courtly living.</p>
